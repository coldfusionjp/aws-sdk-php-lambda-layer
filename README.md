# AWS SDK for PHP Lambda Layer

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/coldfusionjp/aws-sdk-php-lambda-layer/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/coldfusionjp/aws-sdk-php-lambda-layer/commits/master)

The **AWS SDK for PHP Lambda Layer** provides packages of the latest releases of the [AWS SDK for PHP](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php) directly from GitHub into a AWS Lambda layer.

## Quickstart

If you want to get started right away, you can simply use our layers directly with your lambda functions.  Choose an ARN below based on the version of the AWS SDK for PHP required by your application, and attach it as a layer to your lambda function:

* aws-sdk-php-3.110.11: ` ` (2,476,686 bytes)

Currently we only provide the PHP Runtime Layers in the Tokyo (`ap-northeast-1`) region, but we'll expand this soon so they're available in all AWS regions.
